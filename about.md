I'm Andrew Hore, a software developer from Melbourne, Australia!

My professional experience is mostly C# and Microsoft web technologies, alnog with a decent amount of DevOps work using AWS.

This blog was created using Jekyll, a static site generator, and was suprisingly easy to get started with. Find more info on it at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)!
